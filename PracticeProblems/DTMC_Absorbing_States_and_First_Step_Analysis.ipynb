Its not too long, they are very manageable questions and they engage you with the equations and matricies we have to get comfortable with when using absorbing state MC. The main ideas are mean time to absorption and probability of eventual absorption. The main thing I struggled with in this homework was really just finding the time and starting it past 1:00am. I had read the questions several times that late and had a general idea of what I had to do but no brain power to do it."
