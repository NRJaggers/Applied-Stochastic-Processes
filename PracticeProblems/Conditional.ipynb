When the best player plays either of the others, she has a 2/3 probability of winning the match. When the other two players play each other, each has a 1/2 probability of winning the match. But you do not know which player is the best. Based on watching the players warm up, you start with subjective probabilities of 0.5 that A is the best, 0.35 that B is the best, and 0.15 that C is the best. A and B will play the first match.\n",
