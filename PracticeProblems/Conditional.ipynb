When the best player plays either of the others, she has a 2/3 probability of winning the match. When the other two players play each other, each has a 1/2 probability of winning the match.

I certainly struggled with getting back in the groove with stats and thinking big picture with all different possible cases in a situation. I dealt with this by asking for help. I asked my friend and I asked the discord. I still feel I have a bit more rust to shake off but I feel like going through these exercises, getting help and again explaining it to myself after has helped a lot."
