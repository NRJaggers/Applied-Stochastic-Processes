        "My first thoughts on how to implement an MCMC solution for this problem was to use the score when determining probability of acceptance for proposed state transitions (even though I didn't flesh out what those state transitions would be just yet.) I had also initially thought this could be accomplished by a multiple stage MCMC. One chain would take care of finding the max score for a particular configuration and the second would then find the lowest max score between those configurations.\n",
