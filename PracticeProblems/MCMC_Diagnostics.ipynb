If the step size is to big or too small we will get \"stuck\". Also if the step the step size is too big or too small it will affect the autocorrelation function and lag.\n",

Therefore since the best $\\sigma$ or step size is in between a big and small number, the optimum value is somewhere in the middle. This means the largest ESS is somewhere in the middle, hence the selection of D, a parabolic shape with a maximum."
